1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Test your changes.
6. Open a pull request with the `main` branch of this repo as target. Explain your changes in the description of the pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/lorenzovngl/FoodExpirationDates/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project.

> *As this is a free open-source project, and anyone who contributes will be mentioned among all other contributors, no payment will be provided for any contribution.*

## Report bugs
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lorenzovngl/FoodExpirationDates/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
